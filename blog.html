        <p class="about">In this text we see how Abel wants a traditional marriage with a woman he found independent. The mentality he has that women are supposed to bow to men,thought that Trevor's mom would abide with that which was a different case with her.It is seen how violent he is that he reveals his true charaters after marrying Patricia,
                     Abel believes that women are supposed to be surbodnent to men. Because of that, he treats Patricia in a bad way so that she can abid with his rules and beliefs.But he found Patricia as independent woman and who can speak out for her rights, making it contary to what he expected.I see that there is no gender equality in Abel's community(Tzaneen),because men think they are the ones who are right.
                     Over time, Abel grows more aggressive as he drinks more heavily. The first time Abel hits Patricia, he has come home drunk and carelessly set the house on fire. When Patricia gets angry with him, he hits her. Enraged, she goes to the police, but they refuse to take her seriously and her own mother encourages her to reunite with Abel. Abel is not violent
                     again for a long period of time, but he eventually hits her again. Abel's economic situation is also tumultuous: he is a very skilled mechanic, and Patricia helps him find the money to buy his own shop. However, the business struggles and the young family moves into the shop, with Noah being forced to spend all his free time helping out. They live in extreme
                     poverty at times, until Patricia quits her job to spend all her time turning the business around. Things start to improve, but Abel is angry that his wife is taking such an active role in the business. Patricia goes back to work and they sell the business, using a small amount of money to buy the house in Highlands North. She and Abel legally divorce so that
                     her credit and finances will not be impacted by his bad decisions, but they continue to live together and she supports him financially with her salary.

    <p class="paragraph">Blog 2</p>
    <p class="about"> In the whole book, I see how Trevor portrays humor despite the challenges they face him and the mom. Humor is one of the tools that make this book fascinating and it gives
                      you the urge of wanting to know what happens next, it is portrayed when Patricia takes Trevor to meet with his dad, and she acts
                      like she's not the mom. She is a genius that she walks with her neighbor who has the same
                      color as Trevor. And she acts like she is the maid.
                      The book’s closing moment shows Patricia’s remarkable strength and optimism through her humor.
                      Her ex-husband Abel has just shot her in the head and nearly killed her, but she survives; when Noah visits her the second day in the hospital,
                      she tells him to “look on the bright side,” which is that “now you’re officially the best-looking person in the family.” They laugh despite their horrible circumstances, suggesting that their resilience is their greatest asset.
